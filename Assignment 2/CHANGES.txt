I didn't change any large functionality from the original design, I did have to add some though.

On the original design, there were a few class properties that were left out
1. Needed specification on how users should store the calendars they've been added to.
	a. If a user is added to an event that they don't have the calendar for, should they still
		be added?
	b. I chose to implement an EventsAdded list onto the User to keep track of this
2. Added a None visibility to the Visibility enum, was important to give it a default value that was different from public/private
3. Gave the user the ability to view all public calendars (ViewAllPublicCalendars())
4. Changed "UpdateTimezone" in the Event class to "UpdateEvent", so the user can change the necessary data

I believe those were all the differences from the original UML!
